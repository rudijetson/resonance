## LAND PILLAR

*200 responses from 50 residents*

## KEY ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS FOR COMMON GOOD ALLIANCE:

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. **Land trust has strong community buy-in** - Move quickly to capitalize on 78% support
2. **Focus on affordable homeownership first** - This is the clearest, strongest consensus
3. **Address grocery store gap** - Practical need with broad support across demographics
4. **Demonstrate quick wins** - Community needs to see action, not more planning

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Genuine resident control in governance (not just "community input")
- Transparency about property ownership and decision-making
- Protection for both homeowners AND renters
- Speed of implementation matters to aging population
- Learn from Cincinnati examples (what worked in Madisonville/Walnut Hills, what failed in OTR)

**Risk Factors to Address:**
- Deep skepticism based on decades of broken promises
- Fear of displacement is explicit and evidence-based
- Current city responsiveness is extremely low - build trust through action
- Fire department capacity concerns could derail development efforts

This analysis is based on systematic review of all 200 responses across the 50 community members and three neighborhoods.

- Consistent calls for business incubators, technical assistance, mentorship, and lower-barrier pathways to business ownership

**Youth Development & Future Generation** (~45% of responses)
- Investment in education, job training, after-school programs, and teaching financial literacy/entrepreneurship early

**Systemic Discrimination & Historical Context** (~40% of responses)
- Recognition of redlining's legacy, references to historic Black economic success (West College Hill 77% homeownership), and ongoing racial disparities in lending

## 2. CONSENSUS POINTS

- **Near-universal support** (95%+) for a community investment fund specifically supporting Black-owned businesses
- **Shared frustration** with traditional banking systems that are seen as designed to exclude rather than include
- **Agreement** that collective action and pooled resources are necessary since external capital isn't flowing to the community
- **Recognition** that credit scores and debt-to-income ratios are structural barriers that punish past hardship
- **Desire** for transparency, accountability, and community control over any investment mechanisms
- **Understanding** that economic development must be multi-generational and intentional, not quick fixes

## 3. KEY CONCERNS

**Lending Discrimination Persists**
- Different interest rates for same bank in different neighborhoods
- Racial disparities in loan approval despite similar qualifications
- "Redlining never really ended, it just got digitized"

**Catch-22 Situations**
- Need car to get to job, can't get car loan without job
- Need credit history to build credit, can't get credit without history
- Need collateral for loans, can't build collateral without loans

**Predatory Financial Services**
- Payday lenders and high-interest options are only accessible alternatives
- "Predatory lenders target our neighborhoods... charging 400% interest"

**Time & Complexity Barriers**
- Working multiple jobs leaves no time for complicated applications
- Approval processes take so long opportunities pass
- "By the time you hear back, it's too late"

**Permanent Exclusion**
- Past bankruptcy, criminal records, medical debt create permanent barriers
- "One bad period and you're marked"
- COVID credit damage still affecting approvals

**Survey Fatigue & Skepticism**
- "A lot of surveys like this don't lead to anything. Hope this one's different"
- Desire for action, not just more questions

## 4. SUGGESTIONS

- Simplify application processes—"meet people where they are"

**Leverage Existing Assets**
- Partner with churches (trust + resources already exist)
- Connect with Cincinnati's broader Black business networks
- Link to Hamilton County and university resources
- Promote existing programs like $25,000 facade grants more widely
- Use Stepping Stone Event Center as economic development hub

**Inclusive Design**
- Accommodate non-traditional income (gig work, seasonal, tips, self-employment)
- Create senior-accessible programs (not just online)
- Include second-chance pathways for justice-involved residents
- Address childcare as economic infrastructure
- Support women-owned businesses facing "extra barriers"

## 5. NOTABLE QUOTES

> "Banks around here want perfect credit scores and three years of business history... it's designed to be difficult." — Robert Miller

> "We used to have that kind of thing in our communities. Rotating savings clubs. My grandmother talked about them. Time to bring that back." — Tanya Williams

> "Nobody else is coming to save us. But together we have the power to change things." — Tanya Williams

> "Look at what West College Hill accomplished in the past. 77% Black homeownership by 1940. That's our blueprint." — Christopher Jackson

> "Think long-term. Not just quick fixes but structures that will benefit our grandchildren. That's how you build generational wealth." — Margaret Collins

> "Redlining never really ended, it just got digitized." — Charles Wilson

## 6. SENTIMENT BREAKDOWN

**Frustrated but Not Defeated** (60%)
- Tired of systemic barriers but ready to act collectively

**Cautiously Hopeful** (25%)
- Interested in new approaches but skeptical based on past disappointments

**Urgently Determined** (10%)
- Strong language about taking control ("tired of complaining about the problem")

**Pragmatically Patient** (5%)
- Older residents focused on next generation's benefit

**Overall Tone:** Realistic about challenges, grounded in historical knowledge, ready to participate in solutions if they're genuine and community-controlled.

## 7. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

North College Hill residents demonstrate sophisticated understanding of how systemic lending barriers—credit scores, collateral requirements, discriminatory practices, and application complexity—exclude them from traditional capital access. There is overwhelming (95%+) support for a community-controlled investment fund that pools local resources to support Black-owned businesses, reflecting historical mutual aid traditions and a pragmatic recognition that "nobody else is coming to save us." Residents want transparent, accountable structures that accommodate non-traditional workers, provide patient capital with flexible terms, and build multi-generational wealth rather than offering temporary relief.

**Economic Anxiety vs. Cultural Investment** (~25%)
- Tension between basic needs (jobs, infrastructure) and arts funding
- Calls for free/low-cost programming due to financial constraints
- Desire for economic development to precede cultural investment

## 2. CONSENSUS POINTS

✓ **Hamilton Avenue and schools are priority locations** for public art and visibility

✓ **Food Truck Fridays is the proven model** - expand it with music, art vendors, year-round programming

✓ **Affordability is non-negotiable** - cultural programming must be free or very low-cost

✓ **Churches must be partners** in any cultural initiative (they hold social capital and physical space)

✓ **Elders hold irreplaceable knowledge** that must be documented now before it's lost

✓ **Local artists should be hired and paid fairly** - keep money in community, avoid exploitation

✓ **History documentation is urgent** - oral histories, photo archives, family stories need systematic collection

## 3. KEY CONCERNS

**"We've been surveyed before with no action"** - deep skepticism about follow-through and real investment

**"Talented people leave because there's no support"** - brain drain of creative community members

**"Fix basics first"** - significant minority prioritizes infrastructure, safety, and economic issues over arts

**"Pricing out the community"** - fear that cultural programs will be unaffordable for residents who need them most

**"Art won't fix blight"** - concern that murals on abandoned buildings highlight decay rather than address root causes

**"Who controls the narrative?"** - implicit concern about authentic representation vs. outside interpretations

**Time sensitivity** - multiple mentions that elders and knowledge holders are aging; documentation can't wait

## 4. SUGGESTIONS

### Immediate Actions
- **Systematic oral history project** recording elders' stories and memories
- **Photo digitization events** to preserve family and community archives
- **Hire local artist Anthony Stewart and others** for community mural projects (he volunteered at materials cost)
- **Partner with existing institutions**: Revolution Dance Theatre, Clovernook Center, local churches
- **Expand Food Truck Fridays** to include live music, art vendors, activities for kids

### Program Requests
- **Summer concert series** in Stapleton Park (jazz, gospel, local musicians)
- **Gospel festival** bringing together all NCH church choirs
- **Free after-school arts classes** (photography, painting, music, dance)
- **Heritage festival** celebrating Black homesteader families and longtime residents
- **Community talent show** for all ages
- **Pop-up galleries** in vacant storefronts
- **Step shows and dance competitions** with proper staging
- **Intergenerational storytelling** pairing elders with youth
- **Art walk/cultural trail** connecting multiple sites and stories

### Infrastructure Needs
- **Indoor gathering space** for winter programming
- **Gallery/exhibition space** for local artists
- **Affordable artist studio space** with subsidized rent
- **Performance venue** for theater, music, dance

### Public Art Priorities
1. Schools (inside and out) - inspire students daily

4. Community Center - historical mural
5. Library and bus stops - beauty where people wait
6. Entrance signage - artistic welcome to NCH

- Black homesteading and generational wealth
- Gospel music and church choir traditions
- Multicultural diversity (growing Hispanic, African immigrant communities)
- Elders and intergenerational respect
- Women's contributions (often overlooked)
- Food traditions and gardening knowledge
- Barbershops, beauty shops as cultural institutions
- Step teams, dance, and athletic traditions

## 5. NOTABLE QUOTES

**On heritage at risk:**
> "The old-timers tell stories about how this community was built. Those oral histories are priceless. Someone should be recording them systematically." - David Martin

**On economic tension:**
> "Until we invest real money in arts and culture nothing is going to change. Surveys are nice but we have been surveyed before. We need action." - James Robinson

**On cultural definition:**
> "Culture is not just paintings and music - it is how we treat each other and how we raise our children and how we honor our elders. Let us not forget that." - William Harris

**On identity preservation:**
> "Art and culture are how we tell our story to the next generation. Without investment here we lose our identity as a community." - Michelle Brown

**On hope and urgency:**
> "This is exactly the kind of work our community needs. Thank you for asking. I hope something real comes from it." - Eugene Jenkins

## 6. SENTIMENT BREAKDOWN

**Hopeful/Engaged** (35%): Enthusiastic about possibilities, willing to participate, offering specific ideas

**Frustrated/Skeptical** (30%): Want change but doubt follow-through; cite previous disappointments; "show us, don't ask us"

**Nostalgic/Grieving** (20%): Remember better times; mourn loss of cultural vitality and community cohesion

**Practical/Economic Priority** (10%): Believe arts are secondary to jobs, infrastructure, safety concerns

**Neutral/New Residents** (5%): Recent arrivals still learning community; eager to participate but lack history

**Overall tone**: Cautiously hopeful but demanding accountability. Deep cultural pride mixed with real grief over losses. Strong desire for authentic, affordable programming led by and for the community.

## 7. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

North College Hill residents identify rich cultural assets at risk of disappearing—particularly church gospel traditions, Underground Railroad/Cary sisters history, and elder knowledge—but lack basic arts infrastructure (venues, studios, gallery space) that has caused talent drain. There is strong appetite for expanded community events modeled on Food Truck Fridays success, free youth arts education, and systematic heritage documentation, but residents are skeptical about surveys without action and insist on affordable programming, fair artist compensation, church partnerships, and centering elder voices. The community defines culture broadly (from quilting to barbershops to caring traditions) and demands that any initiative address both preservation of Black homesteading legacy and celebration of emerging multicultural diversity.

- **The community itself is worth investing in** - residents consistently mention good neighbors, pride, location advantages
- **Down payment is the #1 barrier** to homeownership for those who could afford monthly payments

## 5. NOTABLE QUOTES

> "Everything in these houses was built around the same time so it all breaks down together." - Darnell Washington (on aging housing stock)

**Overall Tone: Determined but Frustrated** (60% challenging circumstances, 40% hopeful/proud)

- **Pride in Community**: Strong attachment, multi-generational roots, good neighbors

- **Anxiety**: Financial insecurity, aging infrastructure, displacement fears
- **Hope**: Belief in North College Hill's potential, desire to invest if given opportunity
- **Determination**: First-generation homeowners, single parents, people rebuilding after setbacks

**Notable**: Despite significant challenges, nearly all respondents express commitment to staying in North College Hill - the issue is access and sustainability, not desire.

## 7. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

North College Hill residents face a housing crisis driven by aging infrastructure overwhelming current owners with repair costs, while aspiring homeowners struggle with down payment barriers and investor competition. The community demonstrates strong multi-generational attachment and desire for homeownership as wealth-building, but needs coordinated support: down payment assistance for renters, repair loans/emergency funds for owners, vacant property intervention, and infrastructure investment (particularly sidewalks for child safety). With approximately 60% homeownership currently represented and universal desire to stay in the community, residents are requesting targeted programs rather than displacement - they want to invest in North College Hill if given fair access and sustainable support systems.
