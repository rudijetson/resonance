NCH-003,James Thompson,Sunshine,web,LAND,2,"What would you like to see built or developed on vacant land in North College Hill?","Mixed-use development would be nice.

NCH-006,Brenda Mitchell,Sunshine,phone,LAND,2,"What would you like to see built or developed on vacant land in North College Hill?","A recreation center for the kids would be wonderful.

NCH-006,Brenda Mitchell,Sunshine,phone,LAND,3,"Would you support community ownership of land - such as a land trust - in your neighborhood? Why or why not?","Oh yes, I would.
